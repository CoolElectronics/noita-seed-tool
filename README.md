# noita-seed-tool-electron
An electron wrapper for Cr4xy's noita seed tool. it uses .net to grab the seed at a specific memory adress and then inserts it into the seed tool.


I would like to personally apologize for the absolute massacre of the codebase, i had never even heard of a vue before this project

Also contains some code for save scumming


if you complain enough i'll make a linux version
